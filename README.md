Chitragupt is an ambitious project aimed at developing an advanced language model designed to process and respond to queries based on ancient texts. My goal is to leverage the rich, historical content of these texts to create a sophisticated chatbot capable of engaging users with accurate and insightful responses.

Features
Bigram Model: Utilizes a bigram model for parsing ancient texts, allowing for nuanced understanding and generation of text.
Contextual Responses: Provides answers grounded in the historical and scientific context of the text. For instance, if a user asks, "Why does the moon have 27 wives?", Chitragupt delivers a response that integrates both historical and scientific perspectives.
Current Drawbacks
The project is not yet fully trained due to constraints in computational power and resources. With additional support, I am committed to completing the training and fully realizing the potential of Chitragupt. Contributions and support are greatly appreciated.
